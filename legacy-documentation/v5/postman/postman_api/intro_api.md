The [Postman API](https://docs.api.getpostman.com/) has several endpoints to help you integrate Postman  with your development toolchain.

You can add new collections, update existing collections, update environments, or add and run monitors directly through the API. This API enables you to programmatically access your data stored in your Postman account with ease.

The easiest way to start with the API is to click the **Run in Postman** button at the top of the [Postman API documentation page](https://docs.api.getpostman.com/) and use the Postman app to send requests.

### Postman API overview

You need to know three important points about the Postman API:

1.  You need a valid API Key to send requests to the API endpoints. Postman users can get a key in the [Integrations](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/integrations) page.

2.  The API is rate limited.

3.  Using the API, you can add and update collections, environments, and users. You can also run monitors, create a mock server, and so much more.

For more information, see the [Postman API documentation](https://docs.api.getpostman.com/).


### Authentication

An API Key is required to be sent with every request to the Postman API as an `X-Api-Key` request header.

> **If you do not have an API Key, you can easily generate one in the [Postman Integrations Dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/integrations), and click the "Get API Key" button.**

An API Key tells our API server that the request came from you. You can get any data you have permission to access in Postman with an API Key that is generated by you.

For ease of use inside Postman, you could store your API key in an [environment variable](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/variables/) called ``postman_api_key``. This collection automatically uses this key to make API calls.

### Rate Limits

API access rate limits are applied at a per-key basis in unit time. 

Access to the API using a key is limited to **60 requests per minute**. In addition, every API response is accompanied by the following set of headers to identify the status of your consumption.

| Header                | Description   |
| ---                   | ---           |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`   | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per minute. |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining`| The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window. |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`   | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds. |

### Free API calls with your Postman account

Your Postman account gives you a limited number of free Postman API calls per month. You can check your usage limits through the [Postman API](https://docs.api.getpostman.com) itself or the [account usage page](https://go.pstmn.io/postman-account-limits).
