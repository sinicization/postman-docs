Postman helps you be extremely efficient while working with APIs.

With Postman, you can construct requests quickly, save them for later use and analyze the responses sent by the API. Postman can dramatically cut down the time required to test and develop APIs. Postman adapts itself for individual developers, small teams or big organizations equally well.

#### Install Postman

Postman now offers native Mac / Windows / Linux Apps. Unlike the Chrome app, the native apps are packaged with add-ons that make request capturing and cookie handling seamless. Read more about the benefits of using a native app over the Chrome app [here][1].

To install go to [https://www.postman.com/downloads/][2], and click '下载Postman for Mac / Windows / Linux'. (Depending on your platform)

The download should take a few minutes, depending on your internet connection. Once you've downloaded the app, you can install and launch Postman like any other native app.
