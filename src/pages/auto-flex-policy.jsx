                Effective April 8, 2021, Postman offers a more flexible model that simplifies how
                you can add Users to your Postman team. With the &quot;auto-flex&quot; model, you
                can authorize additional Users at any time through the administrative dashboard of
                your Postman Service, instead of having to purchase each additional User license
                with Postman prior to enablement.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will bill you for any additional Users on a monthly basis for monthly plans, and
                on a quarterly basis for annual plans, measured from the date of your initial
                purchase. Shortly before the applicable billing date, your Billing and Admin User
                will receive a notification that reflects the number of added Users during that
                monthly or quarterly cycle. Your Admin User can make adjustments to the number of
                Users on your plan through the administrative dashboard at any time prior to the
                billing date, provided however, once you have been billed you may not reduce the
                number of Users until the end of your then-current Subscription Term. Then, on the
                billing date, you will be billed for the number of additional Users on your plan as
                of the billing date.
              </p>
              <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  On the day you purchase a paid plan, you will be charged for the initial number of
                  Users you select.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you add more Users to your plan after the initial purchase, those User
                  subscriptions will be co-termed with your original User subscriptions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Billing calculations and any changes to the number of Users on your plan will be
                  reflected in your billing statements. For annual plans, we will bill you quarterly
                  for any additional Users; for monthly plans, we will bill you monthly.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2 id="examples">示例</h2>
              <p>Here&#39;s an example of a monthly plan:</p>
              <p className="font-italic">
                Your workspace is on the Team plan and you&#39;re paying monthly — $15 per User per
                month. You add 4 new Users ten days into your monthly billing cycle. You deprovision
                2 Users before the next regular billing date. You will be charged $15 each for the
                total number of Users on your plan as of the billing date, including the 2 Users you
                added during the preceding month and retained as of the billing date.
              </p>
              <p>Here&#39;s an example of an annual plan:</p>
              <p className="font-italic">
                Your workspace is on the Team plan and you&#39;re paying annually — $144 per User
                per year. Your &quot;auto-flex&quot; billing cycle happens at the end of every
                quarter of your annual Subscription Term. You add 4 new Users two months into your
                billing cycle. You deprovision 2 Users before the next regular billing date (i.e.
                the end of the third month of your annual Subscription Term). You will be charged
                for the 2 incremental Users you added during the preceding three month period and
                retained as of the billing date, at the prorated price for the remaining nine months
                of your annual Subscription Term (i.e. $216 total).

              <p className="alert alert-info font-weight-bold text-dark ">
                Paying by annual invoice? We invoice you for a set number of Users for the full
                year. If your team grows larger than anticipated, we’ll send you an invoice once per
                quarter to settle any outstanding balances.

              <h2 id="credit-card-charges">Credit card charges</h2>
              <p>
                You&#39;ll see the first credit card charge from Postman on the day you purchase any
                paid subscriptions. Here are some other times you&#39;ll see charges:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  On the monthly renewal date if your team is on a monthly payment plan. This will
                  include any charges for adding new Users as described in the Auto-Flex team policy
                  sections above.
                </li>
                <li>On the annual renewal date if you are on an annual payment plan.</li>
                <li>
                  On the last day of the quarter, if you are on an annual payment plan and there are
                  any charges due for adding new Users as described in the Auto-Flex team policy
                  sections above.
