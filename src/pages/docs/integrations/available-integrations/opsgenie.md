[Opsgenie](https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie) is an incident management and alerting tool that allows you to effectively manage alerts across the infrastructure. It has several communication features such as SMS, phone calls, and iOS & Android push notifications, and collaboration features such as escalations and schedules.

This integration with Opsgenie triggers an alert in Opsgenie whenever there is an alert in Postman Monitor. The alert will then automatically close after the first successful run.

This integration allows you to configure [Postman Monitors](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/) to trigger alerts on Opsgenie whenever your monitor fails.

## Get the Opsgenie API Key

## Alerts on Opsgenie

An alert on Opsgenie consists of the following information below:

* Description of failing tests (failures in your test scripts you have written in Postman)
* Number of errors (errors occur when Postman is unable to fetch a response from your API)

* Description of failing tests
* Number of failed tests
* Number of passed tests
* Number of errors
* Response time

It will also provide a direct link to the failing monitor.

This integration automatically closes a triggered alert if a subsequent run succeeds. All failures from the same monitor are grouped under the a single Opsgenie alert.

When there is an alert on Postman, you will also see one on your Opsgenie console.
