You can back up your Postman Collections to your Bitbucket repository. Once the integration is configured, any new changes to your collection in Postman will also appear in Bitbucket.

### Configuring a Bitbucket integration

To add a Bitbucket integration, navigate to the [Postman Integrations page](https://go.postman.co/integrations/browse?category=all). Search for Bitbucket and select it from the results.
