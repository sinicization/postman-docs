## Uploading API schemas to AWS API Gateway

You can directly upload your API schemas from Postman to AWS API Gateway. Once the integration is configured, any new changes to your schema in Postman will also appear in your AWS API Gateway.

### Configuring an AWS API Gateway integration

To add an AWS API Gateway integration, navigate to your [Postman Dashboard](https://go.postman.co/). Select your desired workspace > **Integrations**. Click **Browse Integrations**, locate **AWS API Gateway**, and select **View Details**. Click **+ Add integration**.

Enter your AWS access key ID, secret access key, and region, then click **Continue**.

> Learn [how to get your AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/getting-your-credentials.html).

Select your API, API version, and the API Gateway you'd like to deploy to from the dropdown menus. You can use an existing API Gateway, or create a new one by selecting **Create New API Gateway** from the dropdown.

> If you are creating a new API Gateway, auto-deployment will automatically be set to false in AWS.

Your newly created integration will now appear under **Configured Integrations**.

> You can have one AWS API Gateway integration configured for each API version.

To confirm this integration, navigate to your AWS Gateway dashboard, select your API Gateway, then select **Integrations** to view your newly uploaded endpoints.

This integration will be triggered whenever the configured Postman schema is updated. Any configured AWS integrations will be preserved.

> Note that if the API or specific API version is deleted, its configured integration will also be deleted.
