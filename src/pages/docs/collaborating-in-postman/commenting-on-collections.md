> For moderation purposes, admins can delete comments made by anyone, but cannot modify comments.

## Tagging members in comments

When you leave feedback or a question for a specific teammate, you can let them know by tagging them in your comment.

1. In Postman, open the collection or request you want to leave your comment on.
2. Click **Comments** and write your message.
3. To tag your teammate, type "@" and choose their name from the list.
4. Click **Add comment**.

Your teammate will be notified in the app or with an email that they've been tagged in a comment. In-app notifications appear as a red dot above the bell icon at the top right.

> If your teammate has disabled notifications then they will not be notified. If they don't have access to the collection they've been tagged on, they'll need to request access before they can read the comment.
