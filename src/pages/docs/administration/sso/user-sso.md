When your team admin has enabled single sign-on (**SSO**) for Postman, you can log in to Postman with a [configured Identity provider](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/).

Your team admin can provide a **Login URL** that was generated during the SSO configuration. The **Login URL** will automatically redirect you to your configured Identity Provider.

You can sign into Postman by clicking **Sign In** in the upper-right corner of Postman, selecting **Home** in the upper-left then **Sign in**, or by navigating to [Postman's website](https://www.postman.com/) and clicking **Sign In** in the upper-right corner.

When you opt to sign into the desktop version of Postman, you will see the following screen and your default browser will automatically open a webpage asking you to sign into Postman.

> Your browser should open within a few seconds. If it does not, you can click **open your browser** in Postman.

> You must complete the process of signing in within five minutes once you initiate login from Postman. If you go beyond this time, you must return to Postman and restart the sign in process.

Log into Postman by selecting **Sign in with Single Sign-On (SSO)** in the upper-right.

Enter your team domain and **Continue**.

> Check **Keep me signed in** if you would like to remain signed in after your current session for 30 days before re-authenticating. If you do not want to remain signed in on the computer you are working on, uncheck this option. Note that you will be prompted to sign in again after 30 minutes.

Postman will redirect you to the configured SSO provider. Enter your SSO login details to sign in.

> The first time you log in to Postman, you may need to carry out additional steps to set up access to your identity provider account. Sign in using SSO and follow your provider's steps to connect the account to Postman.

Upon signing in, you will see a confirmation in your browser and you will be redirected back to Postman.
