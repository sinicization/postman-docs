The steps in this topic describe how to configure a custom SAML application in Azure AD.

## Configuration

Before you set up a custom SAML application in Azure Active Directory (AD), you must [configure SSO in Postman](/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/). Select "AD FS" as the "Authentication Type" and allow "Identity Provider Details" to remain empty for now.

Next, sign in to the Azure management portal using your Azure Active Directory administrator account.

Browse to the Azure Active Directory > [Directory] > Enterprise Applications, and select "New Application".

Select "Non-gallery application".

Enter the name of the application and click "Add".

Assign a test user to the application. (Required)

In the "Configure Single Sign-on" section, select "SAML-based Sign-on" in the "Single Sign-on Mode" dropdown.

Configure the SAML integration. The table below describes the values of the fields in this configuration.

### SAML integration fields

| **Field**          | **Value**         |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Identifier | The Entity ID for your Postman custom SSO auth. You can find it in the [Team](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams) page.   |
| Reply URL | The ACS URL for your Postman custom SSO auth. You can find it in the [Team](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams) page.  |
| User Identifier  | Select user.mail from the dropdown  |

Download the "SAML Signing Certificate" (Base64 format) and click the **Save** button.

After the setup is complete, submit your Identity Provider details to Postman. For more information, see [SSO简介](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/).

Navigate to your [team settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general) in the Postman Web dashboard. To update the identity provider details, navigate to __Authentication__ &gt; &lt;AzureAuthName&gt; and click __Edit__, then __Proceed__. Fill in the following details:

### Postman custom auth configuration fields

| **Field**         | **Value**         |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Identity Provider Issuer | The SAML Entity ID of your Azure AD application |
| Identity Provider SSO URL | The SAML Single Sign-on Service URL of your Azure AD application |
| X.509 Certificate | Contents of the SAML Signing Certificate file |

Once your details are complete, click __Generate relay/Regenerate relay__ to create a parameter to send with a SAML response in an IDP-initiated single sign-on. Click __Save Authentication__.

Navigate back to your Postman configuration in Azure AD.

![Azure Postman Config](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/ENT-configure-saml.png)

Check the __Show advanced URL settings__ option. This will provide access to the Relay state, where you can enter the parameter you generated in Postman during your custom auth configuration setup.

Save your Azure AD configuration. The setup should now be complete, allowing you to login to Postman using SSO via the Azure AD identity provider.
