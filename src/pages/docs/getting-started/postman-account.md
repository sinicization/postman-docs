A free Postman account allows you to [sync](/docs/getting-started/syncing/) and back up your work so that you can access it from different machines. You can also [collaborate](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaboration-intro/) with others on your API projects.

Signing up for an account is optional—you can use the desktop Postman app without an account if you prefer. Check out the [EULA](https://www.postman.com/legal/eula/), [security overview](https://www.postman.com/security), and [privacy policy](https://www.postman.com/licenses/privacy).

## Syncing your work

When you are logged into Postman, you will see the sync indicator in the header bar.

![Sync icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/syncing.jpg)

When the icon is green, you are connected to the servers and your work is being continuously backed up. Postman will inform you if the sync is interrupted and will automatically try to re-establish the connection.

![Sync connection](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/offline.jpg)

If a conflict arises from a sync issue within your workspace, [Postman will present options for resolving the conflict](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/conflicts/).

> Postman uses WebSockets for real-time [syncing](/docs/getting-started/syncing/). If you are experiencing issues with syncing, you can file an issue with the Postman [support center](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us).

If you have a paid account, you can upgrade your Postman plan by navigating to your [billing dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/overview) and clicking **...** > **Change Plan**.

[![change plan menu](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/change-plan-menu.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/change-plan-menu.jpg)

> The cost of your upgraded plan and/or additional seats will be prorated based on the time left in your team's current billing cycle. For more information, [contact Postman's sales team](mailto:sales@postman.com).
