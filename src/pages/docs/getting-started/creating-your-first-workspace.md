Postman workspaces allow you to organize and collaborate on API projects with your team. Within each workspace you can share APIs, collections, environments, and other components of your work in Postman.

When you first open Postman, you will be in your default personal workspace, but you can create more workspaces for your personal use and to work in conjunction with teammates.

> To create additional workspaces, you need to be signed into a [Postman account](/docs/getting-started/postman-account/).

To access your workspaces, use the dropdown menu at the left of Postman. You can search for existing workspaces using the search bar present below the __Workspaces__ dropdown.

Click __New Workspace__ to add a new workspace.

You can choose a __Team__ workspace if you plan to invite collaborators, a __Personal__ workspace or a __Private__ workspace which is only visible to the user who created it, and team members who have been invited to join it. Enter a __Name__ and optional __Summary__ for your workspace. If you're collaborating, you can invite other people now or later, and select their access level. Click __Create Workspace__.

Postman will switch to your new workspace when you create it. You can then start working in the workspace or __Invite__ people to join it. Select a workspace to switch to it at any time using the dropdown at the top of Postman.
