Postman provides a variety of views and controls for managing your API projects. The Postman UI is made up of the following components:

[![Postman app](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/app-overview-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/app-overview-v8.jpg)

* The left sidebar provides access to your [collections](/docs/getting-started/creating-the-first-collection/), [APIs](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/the-api-workflow/#creating-an-api), [environments](/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/#creating-environments), [mock servers](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/), [monitors](/docs/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/) and request [history](#history).
* The header allows you to create workspaces, access reports, explore the public API network, [search](#universal-search) within Postman, view sync status and notifications, move and invite collaborators to workspaces, capture requests and cookies, access your settings, account, and [Postman plan](/docs/administration/buying/).
* The center area is where you build and work with requests.
* The status bar along the bottom allows you to show/hide the sidebar, [find and replace](#find-and-replace), and open the [console](/docs/sending-requests/troubleshooting-api-requests/) on the left. On the right you can launch the __Bootcamp__, collection runner, trash, two pane view, and access help resources.

[![Resizing panes](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/resizing-panes-v8.gif)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/resizing-panes-v8.gif)

You can also drag to resize the panes in the Postman UI.

[![Resizing panes](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/panes-resized-v8.gif)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/panes-resized-v8.gif)

On the right panel, you will see icons to view the documentation, comments, code and request info.

<img alt="Right panel icons" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/right-panel-view-v8.jpg" height="300px"/>

To open the documentation tab, select the request under your collection and click the Documentation icon<img alt="Mini docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/mini-docs-icon-v8.jpg" width="25px"/> on the right panel.

<img alt="Documentation icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/overview-documentations-v8.jpg"/>

Click __View complete collection documentation__ to open the documentation in a new tab.

<img alt="Overview Documentation" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-pane-v8.jpg" height="400px"/>

To publish a documentation for a collection, see [Publishing your documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/).

To open the comments tab, select the request under your collection and click the Comments icon <img alt="Mini comments icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/mini-comments-icon-v8.jpg" width="30px"/> on the right panel. You can switch to comment mode to leave comments on a specific part of the request, including parameters, headers, body and tests.

[![Overview Comments](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/overview-comments-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/overview-comments-v8.jpg)

To learn more about comments, see [Commenting on collections](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/commenting-on-collections/).

To open the code snippets tab, select the request under your collection and click the Code icon on the right panel. See more on [Generating code snippets](/docs/sending-requests/generate-code-snippets/).

<img alt="Code snippets Pane" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/code-snippet-pane-v8.jpg" height="350px"/>

You can declutter your workspace by collapsing panes. Use the buttons at the bottom-left to hide the sidebar and at the bottom-right to toggle between single and two pane view.

## Universal search

You can access universal search by clicking __Search Postman__ at the top of Postman — or using the keyboard shortcut `Command + K`.

Enter your search string and change the scope of search to narrow down your search results — All of Postman, Team Postman or Public API Network.

<img alt="Changing scope for universal search" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/change-scope-for-universal-search-v8.gif"/>

> For signed in users, the default search scope on workspaces is Team and on [explore](https://explore.postman.com) is Public API Network. For signed out users, all results will contain only public resources since they will not have any private data.

You can additionally change the entity type at the bottom by selecting the required option near **Search for** — Workspaces, Collections, APIs or Teams.

<img alt="Universal search with filter" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/universal-search-filter-by-entity-v8.jpg"/>

If you still did not find what you are looking for, click __Search all workspaces, collections, APIs and teams__ and you will find all the results in one page.

<img alt="Search all" src ="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/search-all-workspaces-collections-and-teams.jpg"/>

The left navigation on the search results page lists the scope and entity type. You can go ahead and change them to filter your results.

<img alt="Universal search results page" src ="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/universal-search-results-page-v8.jpg"/>

You can further filter the results using Sort by on the right - Most relevant, Most views or Most recent.

<img alt="Search results sort" src ="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/search-result-sort-by-v8.jpg"/>

The search result for workspace entity specifies the workspace type, summary, who published it and when was it published.

<img alt="Individual workspace search results" src ="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/individual-workspace-search-results-v8.jpg"/>

The search result for collection entity specifies the workspace type, if the collection is a fork or not, who published it and when was it published.

<img alt="Individual collection search results" src ="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/individual-collection-search-results-v8.jpg"/>

The search result for API entity specifies the name and summary of the API, owner (user/team) and the type of workspace.

<img alt="Individual API search results" src ="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/individual-api-search-results-v8.jpg"/>

The search result for team entity specifies the name and summary of the team. Click the team name and you will be redirected to the team profile.

For Public API network, you can change the entity type to narrow down your search results. Within each of these entities, you can further filter the results based on categories.

<img alt="Public API Network Categories filter" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/public-api-network-filter-categories.jpg"/>

## Find and replace

You can search your Postman workspace by clicking __Find and Replace__ at the bottom-left of Postman—or using the keyboard shortcuts `Command + SHIFT + F` / `Control + SHIFT + F`.

Enter your search string and optionally choose which entities to return, entering replacement text if necessary.

![Find and replace](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/find-and-replace-tab-v8.jpg)

Postman will search tabs, collections, and variables. You can click directly from the search results to open an entity.

## History

You can access a history of the requests you've made in Postman via the __History__ tab on the left of Postman. If you're signed into a Postman account, your history will sync across devices.

<img alt="History Request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/history-request-v8.jpg" height="400px"/>

Click a request to open it again. Click __+__ to save the request to a collection. Toggle __Save Responses__ to save request responses so that you can view what was returned by a request when you open it from your history.

The __View more actions__ menu allows you to save, monitor, document, or mock a request. Use the delete (trash icon) or __Clear all__ options to remove requests from your history. You can multi-select requests by pressing `Command` or `Control` and clicking the requests.

## Tabs

You can send requests in Postman by opening tabs—click __+__ in the center of the screen, or press `Command/Control + T`.

![Tabs](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/open-unsaved-tab-options-v8.jpg)

> If you open a request and do not edit or send it, then open another, the first tab will be replaced by the second. While the tab is in _Preview_ mode it will display in italics.

You can have multiple tabs open at the same time as you work, and can drag tabs to rearrange them. Use the __...__ button to manage tabs and access recent tabs.

> Duplicating a tab does not mean creating a second request to the same endpoint—when you duplicate a tab any edits you make will affect the original request.

Postman will display a dot on any tabs with unsaved changes.

A tab may indicate a conflict if you or a collaborator changes it in another tab or workspace. Postman will prompt you to resolve any conflicts that occur.

> You can toggle whether Postman opens requests in new tabs or not in the __Settings__, as well as configuring whether Postman prompts you when closing tabs with unsaved changes.

## 下一步

The best way to get to know Postman is by firing up the __Bootcamp__ on the bottom-right and working through the lessons.

![Bootcamp](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/bootcamp-lesson-v8.gif)

You can also access Bootcamp together with other resources for getting started and staying up to date by opening **Home** in the upper-left corner.
